# Day 10: Testing & Integration - Complete Application

## Concept Explanation

Testing and integration are essential skills for building reliable, production-ready software. Understanding how to write tests, integrate components, and build complete applications prepares you for real-world development scenarios.

### Key Concepts

#### Testing Fundamentals
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing how components work together
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Measuring how much code is tested
- **Mocking**: Creating fake objects for testing dependencies

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
- **Test Independence**: Tests don't depend on each other
- **Meaningful Test Names**: Describe what is being tested
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Test Data Management**: Use fixtures and factories for test data

#### Integration Concepts
- **Component Integration**: Connecting different parts of a system
- **API Integration**: Working with external services
- **Database Integration**: Connecting to and testing with databases
- **Error Handling**: Managing failures in integrated systems
- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring integrated systems perform well

## Exercise 1: Unit Testing Fundamentals

**Problem**: Implement comprehensive unit tests for a simple calculator service.

**Requirements**:
- Create `CalculatorService` class with basic operations
- Write unit tests for all methods
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

- Achieve high test coverage

**Expected Output**:
```
Unit Testing Fundamentals:

Calculator Service Tests:
testAddition_WithValidNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult - PASSED
testAddition_WithNegativeNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult - PASSED
testSubtraction_WithValidNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult - PASSED
testSubtraction_WithNegativeNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult - PASSED

testMultiplication_WithZero_ReturnsZero - PASSED
testDivision_WithValidNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult - PASSED
testDivision_ByZero_ThrowsArithmeticException - PASSED
testDivision_WithDecimalResult_ReturnsCorrectResult - PASSED

Test Coverage Analysis:
Method Coverage: 100%
Line Coverage: 100%
Branch Coverage: 100%
Overall Coverage: 100%

Test Execution Summary:
Total Tests: 9
Passed: 9
Failed: 0
Skipped: 0
Execution Time: 45ms

Edge Cases Tested:
- Negative numbers

```

## Exercise 2: Mocking and Dependency Testing

**Problem**: Test a service that depends on external components using mocks.

**Requirements**:
- Create `UserService` that depends on `UserRepository`
- Mock the repository for testing
- Test service methods with different mock behaviors
- Verify mock interactions
- Test error scenarios with mocks

**Expected Output**:
```
Mocking and Dependency Testing:

User Service Tests:
testCreateUser_WithValidData_ReturnsUser - PASSED
testCreateUser_WithInvalidData_ThrowsException - PASSED
testFindUser_WithExistingId_ReturnsUser - PASSED
testFindUser_WithNonExistingId_ReturnsNull - PASSED
testUpdateUser_WithValidData_ReturnsUpdatedUser - PASSED
testDeleteUser_WithExistingId_ReturnsTrue - PASSED

Mock Behavior Testing:
UserRepository Mock:
- Mock behavior: Return predefined user for ID 123
- Mock behavior: Throw exception for invalid ID
- Mock behavior: Return empty list for search
- Mock behavior: Return false for delete operation

Mock Interaction Verification:
- Verify createUser() called once with correct parameters
- Verify findUser() called twice with different IDs
- Verify updateUser() called once with valid data
- Verify deleteUser() called once with existing ID

Error Scenario Testing:
- Repository throws DatabaseException: Handled correctly
- Repository returns null: Handled correctly
- Repository timeout: Handled correctly
- Invalid data validation: Handled correctly

Mock Configuration:
Mock setup time: 12ms
Mock verification time: 8ms
Total mock overhead: 20ms
```

## Exercise 3: Integration Testing

testGetUserEndpoint_WithExistingId_ReturnsUser - PASSED
testGetUserEndpoint_WithNonExistingId_ReturnsNotFound - PASSED

Integration Test Data:
Test database: H2 in-memory database

Test data cleanup: All test data removed
Transaction management: Each test in separate transaction

Integration Test Performance:
Database setup: 150ms
Test execution: 300ms
Data cleanup: 100ms
Total integration test time: 550ms
```

## Exercise 4: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Problem**: Implement a feature using TDD methodology.

**Requirements**:
- Write tests first (Red phase)
- Implement minimal code to pass tests (Green phase)
- Refactor code for better design (Refactor phase)
- Implement user authentication feature
- Follow TDD cycle strictly

**Expected Output**:
```
Test-Driven Development Implementation:

TDD Cycle - User Authentication Feature:

Phase 1: Red (Write failing tests)
testUserLogin_WithValidCredentials_ReturnsSuccess - FAILED
testUserLogin_WithInvalidCredentials_ReturnsError - FAILED
testUserLogout_WithValidSession_ReturnsSuccess - FAILED
testUserLogout_WithInvalidSession_ReturnsError - FAILED

Phase 2: Green (Implement minimal code)
