# Day 2: Arrays and Basic Operations

## Concept Explanation
Arrays are ordered collections of values that can store multiple items of the same or different data types. They are indexed starting from 0, meaning the first element is at position 0, second at position 1, and so on.

**Key Array Concepts:**
- **Index**: Position of an element in the array
- **Length**: Number of elements in the array
- **Access**: Retrieve elements using their index
- **Modification**: Change values at specific positions
- **Iteration**: Loop through all elements

## Exercise 1: Array Creation and Access

**Problem**: Create arrays and access their elements.

**Expected Output**:
```
Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
First number: 1
Last number: 5
Third number: 3
Array length: 5
```

## Exercise 2: Array Modification

**Problem**: Modify array elements and add new elements.

**Expected Output**:
```
Original array: [apple, banana, orange]
After changing second element: [apple, grape, orange]
After adding new element: [apple, grape, orange, mango]
Final array: [apple, grape, orange, mango, kiwi]
```

## Exercise 3: Array Iteration

**Problem**: Loop through an array and perform operations on each element.

**Expected Output**:
```
Numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Doubled numbers: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
Sum of all numbers: 150
Average: 30
```

## Exercise 4: Array Search

**Problem**: Find specific elements in an array.

**Expected Output**:
```
Names: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve]
Searching for "Charlie": Found at index 2
Searching for "Frank": Not found
Names starting with "A": [Alice]
```

## Exercise 5: Array Operations

**Problem**: Perform various operations on arrays.

**Expected Output**:
```
Original array: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
Maximum value: 9
Minimum value: 1
Sorted array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
Reversed array: [9, 6, 2, 9, 5, 1, 4, 1]
```
