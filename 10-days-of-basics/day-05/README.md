# Day 5: Loops and Iteration

## Concept Explanation
Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. They are essential for processing collections of data and automating repetitive tasks.

**Key Loop Concepts:**
- **For Loop**: Execute code a specific number of times
- **While Loop**: Execute code while a condition is true
- **Do-While Loop**: Execute code at least once, then check condition
- **Loop Control**: break (exit loop), continue (skip iteration)
- **Nested Loops**: Loops inside other loops

## Exercise 1: Basic For Loop

**Problem**: Use a for loop to count and display numbers.

**Expected Output**:
```
Counting from 1 to 5:
1
2
3
4
5
Sum of numbers: 15
```

## Exercise 2: While Loop

**Problem**: Use a while loop to process data until a condition is met.

**Expected Output**:
```
Countdown from 5:
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```

## Exercise 3: Loop with Arrays

**Problem**: Iterate through an array and perform operations.

**Expected Output**:
```
Numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Doubled numbers: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
Sum: 150
Average: 30
```

## Exercise 4: Loop Control

**Problem**: Use break and continue statements in loops.

**Expected Output**:
```
Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even numbers only: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Stopping at 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
```

## Exercise 5: Pattern Printing

**Problem**: Use nested loops to print patterns.

**Expected Output**:
```
Triangle pattern:
*
**
***
****
*****

Number pattern:
1
12
123
1234
12345
```
