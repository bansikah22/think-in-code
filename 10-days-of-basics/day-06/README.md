# Day 6: Array Methods and Manipulation

## Concept Explanation
Array methods provide powerful ways to manipulate and process arrays. They allow you to add, remove, find, and transform elements efficiently.

**Key Array Methods:**
- **push()/add()**: Add elements to the end
- **pop()/remove()**: Remove elements from the end
- **shift()/unshift()**: Add/remove from the beginning
- **splice()**: Add/remove elements at specific positions
- **slice()**: Extract a portion of an array
- **indexOf()/find()**: Search for elements
- **filter()**: Create new array with filtered elements
- **map()**: Transform each element
- **sort()**: Arrange elements in order

## Exercise 1: Adding and Removing Elements

**Problem**: Use array methods to add and remove elements.

**Expected Output**:
```
Original array: [apple, banana]
After adding orange: [apple, banana, orange]
After adding grape at beginning: [grape, apple, banana, orange]
After removing last element: [grape, apple, banana]
After removing first element: [apple, banana]
```

## Exercise 2: Array Search and Filter

**Problem**: Find and filter elements in arrays.

**Expected Output**:
```
Numbers: [10, 25, 30, 45, 50, 65, 70]
Numbers greater than 30: [45, 50, 65, 70]
Even numbers: [10, 30, 50, 70]
Position of 45: 3
Contains 25: true
```

## Exercise 3: Array Transformation

**Problem**: Transform array elements using map and other methods.

**Expected Output**:
```
Original: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Squared: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
As strings: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Exercise 4: Array Sorting and Slicing

**Problem**: Sort arrays and extract portions.

**Expected Output**:
```
Original: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3]
Sorted ascending: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
Sorted descending: [9, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1]
First 3 elements: [5, 2, 8]
Last 3 elements: [1, 9, 3]
```

## Exercise 5: Complex Array Operations

**Problem**: Combine multiple array operations.

**Expected Output**:
```
Students: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve]
Grades: [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]
High performers (grade >= 90): [Bob, David]
Average grade: 87.6
Top student: David with grade 95
```
