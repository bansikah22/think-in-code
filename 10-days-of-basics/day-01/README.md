# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

## Concept Explanation
Variables are containers that store data values. They have a name, a type, and a value. Understanding data types is crucial because different types of data are stored and processed differently.

**Key Data Types:**
- **Numbers**: Integers (whole numbers) and decimals
- **Strings**: Text enclosed in quotes
- **Booleans**: True or false values
- **Arrays**: Collections of values
- **Objects**: Collections of key-value pairs

## Exercise 1: Variable Declaration and Assignment

**Problem**: Create variables to store different types of data and display them.

**Expected Output**:
```
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Height: 5.9
Is Student: true
Favorite Colors: [red, blue, green]
```

## Exercise 2: Type Conversion

**Problem**: Convert between different data types and observe the results.

**Expected Output**:
```
Original number: 42
As string: "42"
String "123" as number: 123
Boolean true as number: 1
Boolean false as number: 0
```

## Exercise 3: Variable Naming Convention

**Problem**: Practice proper naming conventions for variables.

**Expected Output**:
```
firstName: John
lastName: Doe
userAge: 25
isActiveUser: true
favoriteProgrammingLanguage: JavaScript
```

## Exercise 4: Mathematical Operations

**Problem**: Perform basic mathematical operations with variables.

**Expected Output**:
```
Number 1: 10
Number 2: 5
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Remainder: 0
```

## Exercise 5: String Concatenation

**Problem**: Combine strings using concatenation.

**Expected Output**:
```
Full Name: John Doe
Greeting: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 25 years old.
Address: 123 Main Street, City, Country
```
