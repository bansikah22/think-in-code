## Learning Tips

### Before Starting Each Day:
1. Read the concept explanation thoroughly
2. Understand the expected output
3. Plan your approach before coding

### While Coding:
1. Start with the simplest approach
2. Test your code frequently
3. Don't be afraid to make mistakes
4. Use comments to explain your thinking

### After Completing Each Day:
1. Review your solution
2. Try to optimize your code
3. Experiment with different approaches
4. Compare Java and JavaScript implementations

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Understanding the Problem
**Solution**: Break down the problem into smaller steps. Focus on one TODO item at a time.

### Challenge: Syntax Errors
**Solution**: Pay attention to language-specific syntax. Java requires semicolons and type declarations; JavaScript is more flexible.

### Challenge: Logic Errors
**Solution**: Use console.log/System.out.println to debug. Check your variable values at each step.

### Challenge: Getting Stuck
**Solution**: Take a break, re-read the problem, or try a different approach. Sometimes stepping away helps.

### Challenge: Online Editor Issues
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're using the correct language mode
- Check that your code is properly formatted
- Try a different online editor if one doesn't work
- For JavaScript, make sure to use console.log() for output
