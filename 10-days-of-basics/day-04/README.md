# Day 4: Conditional Logic

## Concept Explanation
Conditional logic allows programs to make decisions based on certain conditions. It uses if statements, else clauses, and comparison operators to control the flow of execution.

**Key Conditional Concepts:**
- **Comparison Operators**: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- **Logical Operators**: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
- **If Statements**: Execute code when condition is true
- **Else Clauses**: Execute code when condition is false
- **Else If**: Check multiple conditions in sequence

## Exercise 1: Basic If Statements

**Problem**: Use simple if statements to check conditions.

**Expected Output**:
```

```

## Exercise 2: If-Else Statements

**Problem**: Use if-else statements to handle different scenarios.

**Expected Output**:
```

```

## Exercise 4: Nested If Statements

**Problem**: Use nested if statements for complex decision making.

**Expected Output**:
```
