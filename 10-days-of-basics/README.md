## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Online Editors (Recommended for Beginners)
**No installation required!** Use these online editors to practice immediately:

#### For Java:
- **[OnlineGDB Java Compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler)** - Simple and fast
- **[Replit Java](https://replit.com/languages/java)** - Full IDE experience
- **[Programiz Java Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/)** - Clean interface

#### For JavaScript:
- **[CodePen](https://codepen.io/)** - Great for web-based JavaScript
- **[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)** - Simple JavaScript testing
- **[Replit JavaScript](https://replit.com/languages/javascript)** - Full IDE experience
- **[Programiz JavaScript](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/)** - Clean interface

### Option 2: Local Development
**For those who prefer local development:**

#### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java exercises
- Node.js for JavaScript exercises
- A text editor or IDE

#### Quick Start
1. **Choose a day** to start with (recommended: start with Day 1)
2. **Read the README.md** in that day's folder for concept explanation
3. **Open the exercise files** (exercise1.java and exercise1.js)
4. **Follow the TODO comments** to implement your solutions
5. **Test your code** and compare with expected output
6. **Move to the next day** when ready

#### For Java:
```bash
cd day-01
javac Exercise1.java
java Exercise1
```

#### For JavaScript:
```bash
cd day-01
node exercise1.js
```
