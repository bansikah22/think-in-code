# Day 10: Mini Project - Simple Calculator

## Concept Explanation
This final day combines all the concepts learned throughout the challenge to build a simple calculator. This project demonstrates how to integrate variables, arrays, strings, conditionals, loops, and validation into a practical application.

**Project Requirements:**
- **Input Handling**: Accept user input for numbers and operations
- **Data Validation**: Ensure inputs are valid numbers and operations
- **Conditional Logic**: Handle different mathematical operations
- **String Processing**: Format and display results
- **Error Handling**: Manage invalid inputs gracefully
- **Loop Control**: Allow multiple calculations

## Exercise 1: Basic Calculator Operations

**Problem**: Create a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

**Expected Output**:
```
Simple Calculator
================
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+,-,*,/): +

Result: 10 + 5 = 15

Continue? (y/n): y
Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 4
Enter operation (+,-,*,/): *

Result: 20 * 4 = 80
```

## Exercise 2: Enhanced Calculator Features

**Problem**: Add more advanced features to the calculator.

**Expected Output**:
```
Enhanced Calculator
==================
Available operations: +, -, *, /, %, ^, sqrt
Enter first number: 16
Enter operation: sqrt

Result: √16 = 4

Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Enter operation: ^

Result: 5 ^ 3 = 125
```

## Exercise 3: Calculator with History

**Problem**: Keep track of calculation history.

**Expected Output**:
```
Calculator with History
======================
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+,-,*,/): +

Result: 10 + 5 = 15

Calculation History:
1. 10 + 5 = 15

Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 3
Enter operation (+,-,*,/): *

Result: 20 * 3 = 60

Calculation History:
1. 10 + 5 = 15
2. 20 * 3 = 60
```

## Exercise 4: Scientific Calculator

**Problem**: Implement scientific calculator functions.

**Expected Output**:
```
Scientific Calculator
====================
Available operations: +, -, *, /, sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt
Enter number: 45
Enter operation: sin

Result: sin(45°) = 0.7071

Enter number: 100
Enter operation: log

Result: log(100) = 2
```

## Exercise 5: Calculator with Memory Functions

**Problem**: Add memory functions (store, recall, clear).

**Expected Output**:
```
Calculator with Memory
======================
Enter first number: 25
Enter second number: 10
Enter operation (+,-,*,/): +

Result: 25 + 10 = 35

Memory functions: M+ (store), MR (recall), MC (clear)
Enter command: M+

Value 35 stored in memory.

Enter first number: MR
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+,-,*,/): *

Result: 35 * 5 = 175
```
